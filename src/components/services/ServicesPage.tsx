      How I can help you achieve your business goal
    </h2>

    <p>
      Complete Product life cycle revolves around these three Drive and Quality
      Risk Management act as lubricant which felicitates frictionless smooth
      running of drive. All these three drives work in tandem.
    </p>

    <h3 className={`${styles.clear} ${articleStyles.h3}`}>
      Process Management
    </h3>
    <p>
      To perform work smoothly, a sound understanding of process is required.
      Sound understanding of process helps organization in identifying critical
      source of variability, helps them in managing that variability smoothly
      and help them achieve reliable and sustainable product Quality.
    </p>

    <h3 className={`${styles.clear} ${articleStyles.h3}`}>Quality System</h3>
    <p>
      Within a well-established Quality system there is inverse relationship
      between process understanding and risk of producing low quality Product.
      It helps in developing a less restrictive regulatory approach, a
      risk-based approach based on scientific rational.
    </p>

    <h3 className={`${styles.clear} ${articleStyles.h3}`}>
      Knowledge Management
    </h3>
    <p>
      Finally, to maintain its reliability and sustainability, continuous
      improvement of knowledge is required, understanding of knowledge should be
      based on scientific rational.
    </p>

    <br />
    <p>
      These three drives along with Quality risk management as a lubricant helps
      organization to establish a system to realize its business goal with
      respect to Internal Customer, External customer, and Regulatory Customer.
      Understanding of these three drives helps Organization in establishing, a
      sustainable, reliable, realistic, and practical Procedure, process,
      control, checks and reporting mechanism in place, and it must be based on
      scientific Documented Rational within the perimeter of Regulatory
      requirements. For example, what is your Procurement, Commissioning,
      Validation, Maintenance and monitoring Program of Critical Utility,
      Equipment’s, and Area? Before Qualifying and Validating, do your employee
      understand System (Procedure and Process) well enough? Do you have a
      Practical, User friendly Standard Operating Procedure in place to help
      anyone to perform activities? Is your employee well trained to not only
      know the Procedure, Process, controls, checks and Reporting mechanism but
      also understand it? Like Albert Einstein has said “Understanding is more
      important than knowing”. Now a days, whoever work in Pharmaceutical
      Industry specifically in Sterile field, they all know cGMP of different
      country, Regulatory requirement of Validation, Specification etc. Most
      important Question is, do they understand, it well enough to translate it
      into practical use?? Are they able to corelate their knowledge in
      practical use?? I leave it to you to decide. What I have understood in due
      course of my professional journey that “All regulatory guidelines carry
      significant value in each sentence and that is based on very solid
      scientific rational. Whatever you choose to perform in, must be based on
      scientific documented Rational “I will help you in establishing a system
      which will take care of all these three main components depicted in
      picture. For me to bring any change in the system or culture across the
      Organization, change should be smooth, it should not be rash and drastic.
      There must be smooth transition. Being a hardcore shop floor person, I am
      better placed to bring the change, because I have vision and ability to
      corelate the things. It is based on my understanding of process and cGMP
      regulatory requirements. I can say firmly, smooth transition in the system
      bring sustainable change. I will take it step by step that too small step,
      one at a time.

        First, I will try to understand the complete system (Complete Process)
        and control.
